<h2>User Guide</h2>

<h3>Before Using Snail Mail</h3>
Before using Snail Mail, you should have some addresses entered into your Mac OS X Contacts (application distributed with Mac OS X), otherwise you will only be able to manually enter addresses each time you want to print an envelope.  Preferably, you should have one of the entries in Contacts marked as "My Card" (choose "Go to My Card" from Contacts's "Card" menu to see if it's set, or choose "Make This My Card" from Contacts's "Card" menu to set it for the selected entry).  Snail Mail, by default, uses your card in Contacts for the return address.

<h3>Selecting a Return Address</h3>

The return address is automatically set to the first address of the "My Card" record in the Mac OS X Contacts, by default.
<p>
If you have more than one address entered in Contacts's "My Card" record, you can choose your return address from the address selection popup menu (next to the "Return Address:" popup menu), which automatically contains all of your "My Card" addresses.  This selection will be remembered next time you use Snail Mail.
<P>
It is also possible to enter a return address manually (see "Manual Return Address" below) or to have no return address printed (see "No Return Address" below).  To change back to having your Contacts automatically kept up to date with Contacts, choose "Contacts" from the "Return Address" popup menu.

<h3>Selecting a Delivery Address (ie Addressing the Envelope)</h3>

Select a delivery address (to whom the envelope is to be sent) by clicking on an address in the list of addresses (which contains all of the addresses from your Contacts)
<BR>OR
<BR>Type part of the name of the delivery address you want in the "Search" field, and the list of names and addresses automatically updates to show those which match the search text you type.

<h3>Printing Single Envelopes</h3>

To print immediately (no dialogue) just click the "Print" button in the toolbar.  Snail Mail will attempt to print 1 copy of the envelope to the printer that was last used in Snail Mail (using the same print settings last used in Snail Mail).
<BR>OR
<BR>Press command-P for a standard print dialogue to choose another printer, enter number of copies, or change other print settings.

<h3>Refining the List of Displayed Addresses</h3>

Click on a group from the Groups list to display only the addresses from that group as defined in Contacts (to add, delete or modify groups, use Contacts application).
<p>
Enter text in the "Search" field to have the list of addresses automatically updated to show those who's names match the search text you type.

<h3>Printing Batches of Envelopes</h3>

To print a batch of envelopes select all of the persons or addresses to be printed (using SHIFT-click or COMMAND-click, or "Select All" from the "Edit" menu) and choose the "Print Selected Envelopes..." command from the "File" menu.
<p>
Depending on settings in preferences this will either print envelopes for all of the selected addresses (default), OR, print one envelope for each of the selected persons with an address matching the label specified in preferences (eg, "Home", "Work").

<h3>Manual Return Address</h3>

If you want to use a return address that is not automatically included from Contacts, you can override the automatic entry of the Return Address by selecting "Manual" from the "Return Address:" popup menu.  When this option is selected, the text of the Return Address on the envelopes will no longer be updated automatically from information in Contacts database.  Now click in the return address area in the envelope window, and enter the text (and/or images) for return address you want.
<P>
Turning on this setting also allows saving of images in the return address or no return address at all - see below.

<h3>Images in Return Address</h3>

Images can be pasted into the return address text on the envelope window.  To have the images remembered between uses of Snail Mail, select "Manual" from the "Return Address:" popup menu.  If more precise formatting of images is required, the entire return address can be saved as an image (using some other image processing application) and then copy/pasted or drag/dropped into Snail Mail's return address area on the Envelope window.
<p>
To include images without using manual return address, see "Background Text and Images" below.

<h3>No Return Address</h3>

If you do not want to have any return address on your envelopes, you can select "None" from the "Return Address" popup menu.  The return address selection popup menu will then be disabled, but it's selection will still be respected for country hiding and barcode display.

<h3>Background Text and Images</h3>

The entire background of the envelope can have any arbitrary text added with the exception of the margins themselves (which are outside the printable area).  To edit text in this area, simply click on the envelope window to bring it to the front, then click anywhere in the envelope window apart from the return address, recipient address, or margins areas (these areas are easier to see if you turn on margin guidelines in the format menu).  Then type and edit your text in the normal way.
<p>
Graphics can also be added to this background area by copy/paste or drag/drop.
<p>
NB:  Because this background area overlaps with the return address and recipient address areas, be careful not to add text or graphics that will interfere with the text in these areas.  It may be necessary to press RETURN or TAB (or both) a few times to avoid typing visible text directly behind the return address, for example.
<p>
Tip:  Using images in the envelope background allows company logos to be placed behind the return address area and be used in conjuction with an automatically placed address from Contacts.  Because the left margin of the return address and the left margin of the background area are usually the same an extra step is necessary if you wish to have a graphic placed to the left of the return address (as is often the case for a company logo, for example).  To do this, open the "Text Attributes" window using the toolbar button, or the command in the "Format" menu, then select all the text in the Return Address Fields area, and choose "Show Ruler" from the "Format" menu.  Using this ruler, drag the left line starting markers to the right enough to make room for the desired graphic, then click "OK".

<h3>Envelope Profiles and Page Setup</h3>
An envelope profile is simply a set of standard "Page Setup" settings and Snail Mail "Margins" settings.  Snail Mail is initially configured with one default envelope profile (#10 envelope with appropriate margins) called "Default".

<h4>Add, Delete or Rename Envelope Profile</h4>
Choose "Edit Profiles..." from the "Envelope Setup" poup menu in the Snail Mail window.  This will display the "Envelope Profiles" window.  From here you can click "New" to add a profile, "Delete" to delete the selected profile or double-click a profile name to change its name.
<p>Note:  You cannot delete the last remaining profile (there must always be at least 1 profile), and you cannot have 2 profiles with the same name.

<h4>Edit an Envelope Profile's Envelope Setup (Page Setup and Margins)</h4>
To change the settings for an Envelope Profile, choose the profile from the "Envelope Setup" popup menu, then use the "Page Setup..." command in the "File" menu to change paper size, orientation, etc, and use the "Margins..." command in the "Format" menu to change margins settings (see "Margins" below).

<h3>Margins</h3>

Use the "Margins..." command in the "Format" menu to change the margin settings for both the return address text area and the delivery address text area on the envelope.
<p>
There is also a "Margin Guidelines" command in the "Format" menu which toggles grey lines which can help you in seeing exactly where the margins are on the envelope window (these lines can be left on, if desired, without being printed).

<h3>Default Text Attributes</h3>
Snail Mail can remember the text attributes (eg, font, colour, size, style) that you prefer for both delivery address and return address.  You can set different attributes for different fields (ie, The name can be larger and/or in a different font or colour to the rest of the address).
<p>
To set the default text attributes, click the "Text Attributes" button in the toolbar, or choose the "Address Text Attributes" command from the "Format" menu, then in the window that appears, select the field(s) for which you wish to change attributes, then use the standard "Font" panel (which is also on screen) to change the attributes for the selected field(s).

<h3>Inter-Application Features</h3>

<h4>System Services</h4>
The following 3 Snail Mail services are available to other applications.  Please note that Snail Mail must be installed in a standard Applications location (eg /Applications) for these to work.  Additionally, these services will not be available until after the next login after installation. You may also need to enable them in System Services->Keyboard->Services->Text.
<br><br>
<b>Selected Text to Snail Mail Envelope</b> - Places the selected text from the current application into the delivery address text area in the Snail Mail envelope window.
<br>
<b>Snail Mail Envelope Text to Current Document</b> - Places the text from the Snail Mail Envelope window's delivery address text area into the current application's front-most window, at the insertion point (replacing any selected text).
<br>
<b>Selected Text to Snail Mail Print</b> - Places the selected text from the current application into the delivery address text area in the Snail Mail envelope window, and invokes Snail Mail's print command.  ie, address and print an envelope using any text from any Services-Compliant application.

<h4>Other Inter-Application Features</h4>
Many Mac OS X Applications were not services-compliant (ie, all Carbon applications, as of OS X 10.2.x).  Therefore to supply similar functionality to these applications there are "Copy Address" and "Paste Address" toolbar buttons in Snail Mail's main window to copy/paste text quickly between the envelope window's delivery address text area and the system clipboard (where it can be copied/pasted into any other application).  This is a little faster than selecting the text in the envelope window and manually copying and pasting text using the Edit menu.

<h3>Preferences</h3>

Using the "Preferences..." command in the "Snail Mail" menu, the behaviour of Snail Mail can be altered as described for each setting below.  All of these settings are off by default.

<h4>Hiding Fields</h4>
Select the checkbox(es) for any "Hide..." field(s) to avoid having those fields displayed in addresses.
<p>
Enter text in the prefix or suffix field(s) to have that text printed before/after the address(es) on the envelope.  For example, a useful return address prefix might be, "If undeliverable, return to:"; or a useful addresse prefix might be, "Attn: Accounting Dept".

<h4>Local Country Variants:</h4>
Some countries can be referred to by several different names (eg, "United Kingdom", "UK", "U.K."), so in order for Snail Mail to be able to tell that these different names all refer to the same country as the return address, enter the names in this field (each on a separate line).  Snail Mail will treat each of these as though it was the same as the return address country, for the purposes of country hiding and barcoding.

<h4>Return Address Popup Includes:</h4>
By default, the Return Address popup menu in the main Snail Mail window contains all addresses in the special "My Card" record in Contacts (if it exists).  If you want to be able to choose return addresses from some other Contacts record, choose either "All Addresses", to have every address listed in the Return Address popup, or choose a group (as defined in Contacts) to show every address from that group.

<h4>Use Barcodes:</h4>
Choose a barcode scheme to have those type of barcodes displayed/printed on your envelopes, or choose "(None)" to stop using barcodes.  NB:  Barcodes will only be printed if Snail Mail thinks the return address and delivery address are for the same country.  You can add other countries for which barcodes should always be printed in the "Local Country Variants" (see above).

<h4>Print Selected Envelopes</h4>
By default, the "Print Selected Envelopes" command ("File" menu) prints one envelope for each selected address, however, if some persons records in Contacts have several addresses (eg, one for work and one for home), you may want to automatically choose home addresses only, or work addresses only.
<p>
To only print addresses that match a particular label (eg, "Home", "Work") enter the label into the "Only Print Label" field in the Preferences window.  Using this setting, one envelope is printed for each selected person who has a matching address (the address actually selected in the main window is ignored, only the selected person is used).
<p>
If some records do not have an address that matches the label you've entered (eg, "Home", "Work"), you can select the "Print Other Address if No Matching Label" checkbox to print an envelope for another address (if the record has another address).  This way, you can be certain to print an envelope for every person with an address, even if some of the person records do not have an address that matches the label you've entered.

<h3>Editing Delivery Addresses</h3>

You can make one-off changes by editing the delivery address text directly in the envelope window, but such changes will not be saved in Contacts.
<P>
To make permanent changes to an address, double-click the address in the address list, and Contacts will open that record in edit mode.  To add or remove addresses, click on Snail Mail's "Contacts" button to open Contacts in browse mode. (see Contacts documentation for more information on editing, adding and deleting addresses).
